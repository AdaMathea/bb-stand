<p>Hello, and thank you for your response!</p>

<p>We are an ensamle of people who play together because it's fun, and we sure want you to join us!</p>

<p>We usually meet every Thursday at 19.00 in the basement of the physics buildning. We then play for 2ish hours. After rehersals we usually hang out and drink [1], talk and enjoy life. </p>

<p>If you are the kind of person who eats food, we can inform you that some of us usually meets at Frederikke spiseri around 17.00 for some pre-rehersal dinner. You are most welcome here as well!</p>

<p>We are hoping to see you at a rehersal!</p>

<p>Regards,<br>Biørneblæs</p>
